# STED_Synapse_Pipeline
This pipeline accepts STED images as .ome files that have been stabilized and deconvolved using the Huygens software.

Through Fiji, images are thresholded and analyzed for presynaptic and postsynaptic particle data. TThe MATLAB script automatically runs the Fiji macro using the Miji integration package and produces additional data reflecting the overlaps between presynaptic and postynaptic particles.
